DEMONSTRATION
-------------

### Find one
```php
$post = $this->PostModel->findOne(123)
```

### Find with Query Builder
```php
$posts = $this->PostModel->find()
  ->where('is_public', '1')
  ->limit(0,25)
  ->order_by('id')
  ->get()
  ->result_array();
```

---

INSTALLATION
------------

Run Composer in your Codeigniter project:

    composer require yidas/codeigniter-model
    
Check Codeigniter `application/config/config.php`:

    $config['composer_autoload'] = TRUE;
    
> You could customize the vendor path for `$config['composer_autoload']`

---

CONFIGURATION
-------------

### Extend BaseModel for Your Application Models

You could extend the `BaseModel` for each model in your application, but we recommend you to make a My_model extended `BaseModel` for each model.

### Extend BaseModel for Your Application BaseModel

You could make My_model for each model in your application.

Example of [My_model](https://github.com/yidas/codeigniter-model/blob/master/example/My_model.php):

>Based on BaseModel, My_model is customized for your web application with features, such as the verification of user ID and company ID for multiple user layers.
>
>This example My_model assumes that a user is belong to a company, so each data row is belong to a user with that company. The Model basic funcitons overrided BaseModel with user and company verification to implement the protection.

USAGE
-----

### find()

Create an CI Query Builder instance with Model Filters for query purpose.

```php
$posts = $this->PostModel->find()
    ->where('is_public', '1')
    ->limit(0,25)
    ->order_by('id')
    ->get()
    ->result_array();
```

```php
// Without all featured conditions for next find()
$posts = $this->PostModel->find(true)
    ->where('is_deleted', '1')
    ->get()
    ->result_array();
    
// This is equal to withAll() method
$this->PostModel->withAll()->find();
```

### findOne()

Return a single record array by a primary key or an array of column values with Model Filters.

```php
$post = $this->PostModel->findOne(123);
```

### findAll()

Return a list of records that match the specified primary key value(s) or a set of column values with Model Filters.

```php
$post = $this->PostModel->findAll([3,21,135]);
```

### insert()

Insert a row with Timestamps feature into the associated database table using the attribute values of this record.

```php
$result = $this->Model->insert([
 Â   'name' => 'Nick Tsai',
    'email' => 'myintaer@gmail.com',
]);
```

### batchInsert()

Insert a batch of rows with Timestamps feature into the associated database table using the attribute values of this record.

```php
$result = $this->Model->batchInsert([
     ['name' => 'Nick Tsai', 'email' => 'myintaer@gmail.com'],
     ['name' => 'Yidas', 'email' => 'service@yidas.com']
]);
```

### replace()

Replace a row with Timestamps feature into the associated database table using the attribute values of this record.

```php
$result = $this->Model->replace([
    'id' => 1,
    'name' => 'Nick Tsai',
    'email' => 'myintaer@gmail.com',
]);
```

### update()

Save the changes with Timestamps feature to the selected record(s) into the associated database table.

```php
$result = $this->Model->update(['status'=>'off'], 123)
```

```php
// Query builder ORM usage
$this->Model->find()->where('id', 123);
$result = $this->Model->update(['status'=>'off']);
```

### delete()

Delete the selected record(s) with Timestamps feature into the associated database table.

```php
$result = $this->Model->delete(123)
```

```php
// Query builder ORM usage
$this->Model->find()->where('id', 123);
$result = $this->Model->delete();
```

```php
// Force delete for SOFT_DELETED mode 
$this->Model->delete(123, true);
```


---

SOFT DELETED
------------


### forceDelete()

Force Delete the selected record(s) with Timestamps feature into the associated database table.

```php
$result = $this->Model->forceDelete(123)
```

```php
// Query builder ORM usage
$this->Model->find()->where('id', 123);
$result = $this->Model->forceDelete();
```


### restore()

Restore SOFT_DELETED field value to the selected record(s) into the associated database table..

```php
$result = $this->Model->restore(123)
```

```php
// Query builder ORM usage
$this->Model->withTrashed()->find()->where('id', 123);
$this->Model->restore();
```

### withTrashed()

Without SOFT_DELETED filter(condition) for next find()

```php
$this->Model->withTrashed()->find();
```


---

QUERY SCOPES
------------


### withoutGlobalScopes()

Without Global Scopes filter(condition) for next find()

```php
$this->Model->withoutGlobalScopes()->find();
```

### withAll()

Without all Model filter(condition) for next find()

```php
$this->Model->withAll()->find();
```
